    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Fry jamuns on low to medium flame to ensure even cooking without browning the outside before the inside cooks.</li>
            <li>Create small dough balls, as they expand during frying and soaking in syrup.</li>
            <li>Allow fried jamuns to cool briefly before adding them to warm, not hot, sugar syrup to prevent them from shrinking.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal parts and gently shape smooth, crack-free balls without kneading or applying excessive pressure.</li>
